//! Distant terrain beyond the view: made on the GPU straight from the dimension's terrain at a
//! coarser step (`shaders/terrain.wgsl`'s `lod`), so it reaches as far as wanted for a few
//! kilobytes a tile. A tile is 32x32 cells of 2^level blocks; each cell is the column at its
//! middle: its top block, the one under it, its biome, and tree canopies over it. Where saved
//! cubes made a column's top other than the terrain's (a town, a crater), the server says so
//! (`server::lod_tops`) and that column is taken instead. What stands above the ground is drawn
//! as its own spans, so a building keeps its roof and its walls.
//! Tiles are picked by distance, nearer ones split into the four of the level below; one is
//! shown once made, its parent or children standing in until then. Where a column of real cubes
//! shows its ground the tiles' pixels are dropped (`fs_lod`, `Lod::mask`), so they fill in for
//! cubes not made or meshed yet (flying fast), and nowhere stand through them.
