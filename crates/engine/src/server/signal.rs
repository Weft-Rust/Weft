//! Redstone. The engine runs it like liquids, blocks only say what they are (`abi::SignalDesc`).
//!
//! A connected wire is one network, its power worked out from what feeds it when that changes, so
//! a wire costs nothing per block and a circuit nothing while it isn't changing. Gates act after a
//! delay, from a timing wheel. A tick reads everything as the last one left it and then applies
//! what changed, so no order of going through blocks shows: a build behaves the same however it is
//! turned. Every loop goes through a gate, so a tick always settles. See `wire.rs` for the shape.
//!
//! Power reaches a block two ways. A gate or lever into it powers it strongly: wire touching it
//! takes that power, and so do devices. Wire on it powers it weakly, for devices only, or all
//! wires on one wall would be one wire. What is cut off by unloaded blocks keeps its state.
